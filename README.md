==========

Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client (http://getPocket.com) for webOS and LuneOS. Works in Browser, too. May be portable to Firefox OS or other systems.
Includes spritz support (needs node.js service or active internet connection).

A node.js service for webOS and LuneOS is included. It allows complete download of articles and images for offline use. Also it allows offline download of the spritz-client. So a complete offline use of the app is possible. In fact that was one of the design goals.


Build & install on connected webOS or LuneOS device
